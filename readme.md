# Backbone and Topcoat

A demonstration application of using Backbone with Topcoat. Also: a sweet Jazz mixtape!

The stack:

- Zepto
- Lowdash
- Backbone
- Topcoat

## Build Chain

What we're building is always more important than how we build it. That said, some architectures are more compassionate than others. 

This particular application uses the following:

- Node
- grunt
- browserify
- npmcss

There are many ways to build an app. This is but one.

## TODO

- topdoc
- locally overridable theme using stylusify
- copy in font/img
- min html
- move tasks out to discreet node modules
- grunt-gh-pages
- gitignore dev files in ./public
- report bug: npmcss seems to require .css extn on absolute imports
- FIXME unpausing restarts the song
- TODO loop through tracks
- TODO localStorage state
- TODO seek in track
- TODO hoverstate for list items
- TODO show currently playing/paused
